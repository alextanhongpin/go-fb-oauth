# Facebook OAuth2

To test it on localhost, ensure that your application is set to `Development` mode in `developers.facebook.com/apps`.


`App ID` and `App Secret` can be obtained in `Settings > Basic`.

Set the `Valid OAuth Redirect URLs` in `Products > Facebook Login > Settings`. E.g. `http://localhost:8080/oauth2Callback`.
